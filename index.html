							<article id="work">
								<p>Growing up in Kenya, I always had a strong desire to expand the knowledge and use of artificial intelligence and computer technology. I envisioned a future where technology could drive innovation and improve the quality of life in my community and beyond. This aspiration fueled my passion for coding and my commitment to making a positive impact through technology.</p>
								<p>At the University of Calgary, I am fortunate to be surrounded by a vibrant community of learners and educators who inspire me every day. Through my coursework and projects, I have developed a strong foundation in various programming languages and technologies, and I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills.</p>
								<p>Beyond academics, I am involved in a few student organizations and tech communities. These experiences have not only enhanced my technical abilities but also helped me develop leadership and teamwork skills. I enjoy collaborating with others on projects and learning from their perspectives.</p>
								<p>My goal is to use my skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions that can make a positive impact on society. I am particularly interested in developing applications that address environmental and social challenges. I believe that technology has the power to change the world, and I am eager to be a part of that change.</p>
								<p>Thank you for visiting my website. I hope you find my projects and aspirations inspiring. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, collaboration ideas, or just want to connect!</p>
